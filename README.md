# Fish Buddy
### A Solution to all our Problems
---

### Overview
Fish Buddy is an app that allows its users to have a personal way to track their catches and gear that they used. The site was built using **Python, Django, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, PostgreSQL, Materialize**.

The app has full **CRUD** functionality for users that are logged in. A logged-in user may add new species and edit or delete their own species and gear. Any visitor to the site can view the home page and the about page, but they do not have authorization to add their species and their own gear. Authentication / authorization is achieved with the built in features of **Django**.

### Getting Started
This application can only be used if you are a logged in user.

**To login**, click on the Log in button in the top right corner of the page. This will allow you to login using your username and password. 

Once you are logged in, you can **add a new species**. That new post will then appear in your index feed.  

Now, when you click on one of your species, you'll be directed to its corresponding details page. You will see the **edit** and **delete** button for your species. By clicking the edit button, you'll be taken to the edit page and when you click the delete button you will be taken to a page where you can **delete** your species. 

**To logout**, simply hit the log out button in the top right corner of your screen.

### Future Improvements
I want to add the ability for the user to post pictures of their catch that corresponds with the catch log. I want to add the ability for you to add other users as friends and be able to see their page.
